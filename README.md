In a team of six, we developed a stadium matching system, Jöinee, for the course final project. It is a two-sided platform to match stadium/court owners with the public who want to play sports. 
As the project manager, product manager and UI/UX team leader of the project, my tasks include:
- Define the product and ensure the team efficiently develops a high-quality product meeting user requirements within the given timeline.
  - If you would like to check out the repositories, issues, and progress we've made, please visit [Jöinee-IM](https://github.com/Joinee-IM).
- Design the mockup of the website in collaboration with another team member.
